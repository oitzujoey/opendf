## Build

There are two ways to build this mod. The manual way is to run "make", copy the qvm files to the pak directory, and then zip it up. If you are on Windows, this is the only way. On Linux, there is a faster way that uses the "mod.bash" script. Simply run "./mod.bash", and the script will build and make the mod. The mod will then be copied to your OpenArena home directory. If a map name is given as an argument, the script will start OA and load the map with cheats enabled.

## Notes

I know that CPM is incorrect. If you have improvements, please tell me. I admit that I used some [code](https://web.archive.org/web/20070214143052/http://games.linuxdude.com/tamaps/archive/cpm1_dev_docs.zip) (It's a zip) that fell under the old Q3A mod license, but I have tried to purge it. This has resulted in a less accurate imitation of CPM physics. At least you have access to the source code as a result.
