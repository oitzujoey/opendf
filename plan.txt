And the plan is... make it up as I go.

And here is what I have made up:

Physics
    VQ3
    CPM - reverse engineered
    Quake World - as close as possible
    Q2 - partial if any
Server side timing and storage system using a modified engine if necessary.

Ideally, I will allow any physics type including custom, but that will have to be recorded along with the level completion stats.

Priorities:
    Get CPM working
        Done
    Get timing triggers working
        Done
    Get timing working
        Done
    Get automatic demos working
        Part of the reason we have Defrag.
    Get client side stat storage working
        Is worthy of the name "Defrag".
    Get server side stat storage working
        This is to support the system below.
    Get item spawn modifications working
        Defrag item spawns work differently than in baseq3.
    Get server stats display system working
        !top and !speeds should work now.
    Get QW movement working
        Quake will live on!

How do I make a single trigger (multi_trigger, wait=-1) reset?
G_SpawnEntitiesFromString(); might do the trick.
