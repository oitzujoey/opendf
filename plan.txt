And here is what I have made up:

Physics
    VQ3
    CPM - reverse engineered
    Quake World - as close as possible
    Q2 - partial if any
Server side timing and storage system using a modified engine if necessary.

Ideally, I will allow any physics type including custom, but that will have to be recorded along with the level completion stats. Since I 

Priorities:
    Get CPM working
        For convenience.
    Get timing triggers working

    Get server stats display system working
        !top and !speeds should work now.
    Get QW movement working
        Quake will live on!
